# drag_and_drop

A new Flutter project. I make a Draggable And Drag & Drop In Flutter.

## Getting Started

As a Flutter developer, you may have come across the terms “Draggable” and “Drag And Drop” when working with user interfaces. These two features can greatly enhance the user experience of your app by allowing users to interact with elements on the screen more intuitively.

Draggable in Flutter refers to a widget that can be dragged around the screen by the user. This is particularly useful when you want to create a draggable item that the user can move to a specific location on the screen. For example, you can use a draggable widget to create a game where the user needs to move an object to a specific location to score points.

To use the Draggable widget, you need to wrap the child widget that you want to make draggable with the Draggable widget. You can then specify the parameters such as the feedback widget that appears when the user is dragging the draggable widget, the data that the draggable widget carries, and the axis on which the widget can be dragged.

Drag And Drop in Flutter is similar to Draggable, but it involves dragging an item and dropping it onto another widget. This is useful when you want to create an interface where the user can drag an item from one place and drop it onto another widget to act.

To use Drag And Drop in Flutter, you need to use the DragTarget widget to define the area where the draggable widget can be dropped. You can then specify the onAccept function that is called when the user drops the draggable widget onto the DragTarget widget. You can also use the onWillAccept function to specify if the DragTarget widget can accept the dropped item.
